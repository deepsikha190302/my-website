      <td> Life is a journey, long and winding <br>
        Full of twists and turns, with no clear finding <br>
        We wander through it, seeking our way <br>
        Hoping to discover what we should do each day <br>
      </td>

      <td>
        Sometimes we stumble, and fall to the ground <br>
        Our hearts heavy, and our spirits unsound <br>
        But we mustn't give up, we must persevere <br>
        For the path to our destiny will soon become clear <br>

      <td>
        Our journey is unique, no two are the same <br>
        And the road we travel is not for fame or gain <br>
        It's to find our purpose, and to fulfill our soul <br>
        To make a difference, and to reach our goal <br>
      </td>
      <br>
      <td>
        So let's not be afraid to take the first step <br>
        To embrace the journey, with all its depth <br>
        For in the end, when we look back and see <br>
        Our journey was worth it, and we were meant to be. <br>
